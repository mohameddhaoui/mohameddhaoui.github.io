I was graduated from Tunisia Polytechnic School (TPS), a center of excellence in engineering education system in Tunisia , majoring in Economic And Scientific Management . Actually , I am a data analyst at SLPV analytics . It is an expert in quantitative analysis: data processing, multivariate analysis (segmentation, clustering, drivers’ analysis,…), econometric modeling, machine learning and other methods used for the analysis of large amount of data . In relation to its core specialization, SLPV also provides the following services: dashboards set up, data visualization, expert support in quantitative analysis, training.
I am pursuing a Big Data Advanced Post-Graduate Master in Telecom-Paristech in order to enhance my analytical skills in IA and especially to strengthen my knowledge in Data Engineering ( Hadoop , Spark , Hbase , Cassandra , Kafka , Cloudera , AWS ..)
Data science and Business Intelligence have always been passions of mine. I have always loved the challenge of finding the right kind of data, analyzing it and coming up with answers to big problems, and then presenting those insights out in ways that people understand .

I strive for continuous progress in everything I do, and so am keen to work in an environment which encourages me to succeed and grow professionally where I can utilize my skills and knowledge appropriately.
