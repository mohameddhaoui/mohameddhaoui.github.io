I was graduated from Tunisia Polytechnic School (TPS), a center of excellence in engineering education system in Tunisia , majoring in Economic And Scientific Management . My first experience in Data was in 2016 during my final academic project at Liebherr Aerospace (Toulouse) which was about Predictive maintenance . I joined in Sept 2016 **SLPV analytics**  as a data scientist  . It is a parisian startup and  an expert in quantitative analysis: data processing, multivariate analysis (segmentation, clustering, drivers’ analysis,…), econometric modeling, machine learning and other methods used for the analysis of large amount of data . In relation to its core specialization, SLPV also provides the following services: dashboards set up, data visualization with Tableau and Qlickview, expert support in quantitative analysis, training.

In Sept 2018 , I decided to enroll in a Big Data Advanced Post-Graduate Master at Telecom-Paristech in order to enhance my analytical skills in IA and especially to strengthen my knowledge in Data Engineering ( Hadoop , Spark , NoSQL , Cassandra , Kafka , Cloudera , AWS ..) . In parallel of the training , I kept working with SLPV analytics as  a Freelancer .

Data science and Business Analysis have always been passions of mine. I have always loved the challenge of finding the right kind of data, analyzing it and coming up with answers to big problems, and then presenting those insights out in ways that people understand .

I strive for continuous progress in everything I do, and so am keen to work in an environment which encourages me to succeed and grow professionally where I can utilize my skills and knowledge appropriately.
